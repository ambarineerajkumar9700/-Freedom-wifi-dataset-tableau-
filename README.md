ðŸ“Œ Dataset Name:  Freedom wifi 

# Summary 
The dataset provides insights into the political and civil liberties landscape across different countries and years. Key attributes include Civil Liberties and Political Rights scores, which help determine a countryâ€™s Status (e.g., Free, Partly Free, Not Free). Countries are further categorized by Region_Code and Region_Name, enabling regional comparisons. The is_ldc column indicates whether a country is classified as a Least Developed Country (LDC), offering a lens into economic and developmental challenges.

By analyzing trends over time, this dataset helps assess how democracy and freedoms evolve globally. Countries may improve or decline in rankings due to policy changes, governance, or external influences. Visualizing this data in Tableau can reveal patterns such as regional disparities, trends in political rights, and correlations between economic status and liberties.

# Conclusion
This dataset provides valuable insights into global political and civil liberties, enabling a deeper understanding of democracy trends across different regions. By analyzing Civil Liberties and Political Rights scores, researchers can assess how countries evolve in terms of freedom and governance. The classification of nations as Free, Partly Free, or Not Free helps track progress or decline over time.

Additionally, the inclusion of Least Developed Country (LDC) status allows for the exploration of economic and political relationships, highlighting challenges faced by underdeveloped nations. Regional analysis further uncovers disparities in governance and rights.

By leveraging Tableau visualizations, users can create interactive dashboards to identify patterns, compare regions, and predict future trends. This dataset serves as a crucial resource for policymakers, academics, and analysts aiming to promote democratic values, human rights, and global development. It ultimately aids in understanding the dynamic nature of freedom worldwide.
